# Garf's Pizza Palace - Devlog

**28 April 2021**

Initialized repository with README file, and began writing code based on design objectives outlined in README. Completed 14 classes that encompass Pasta creation (`Pasta`, `Spaghetti`, `Linguine`, `Fettucine`, `Penne`, `Lasagna`, `PastaFactory`) and Pizza decoration with four basic toppings (`AbstractPizza`, `Pizza`, `AbstractDecorator`, `PepperoniDecorator`, `MushroomsDecorator`, `HamDecorator`, `PineappleDecorator`). All classes compile successfully; no test cases or client applications developed as of yet.
