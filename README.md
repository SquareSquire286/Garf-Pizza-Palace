# Garf's Pizza Palace

*Garf's Pizza Palace* is a Java application designed to simulate ordering food at an Italian restaurant. The restaurant offers two types of dishes: pizza and pasta. The user can select one of several preexisting meals, or choose to customize their own meal with a variety of toppings and garnishes. Upon completing their order, the ingredients and price of the selected meal are outputted to the user.

The application incorporates two design patterns, with one being creational and one being structural. The selection of noodles for a pasta dish is handled by the **Factory** design pattern, which defers instantiation of a superclass (in this case, the Pasta class) to its subclasses (Spaghetti, Lasagna, Linguine, Fettucine, Penne). As well, addition of toppings to a customized pizza is administered by the **Decorator** design pattern, which enables dynamic alteration of an object's behaviour without modifying the class to which the object belongs.
